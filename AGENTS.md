# Codex Agent Guidelines

**Welcome, Codex Agent!** Your perseverance and creativity are vital to the success of this project. Approach each task with determination and keep pushing forward. Even if you stumble, learn from the experience and try again. Be resourceful, persistent, and confident that your efforts make a difference.

This is a large multi-module Maven project. Building and testing the entire repository can take considerable time. It's not unusual for test execution to take 5â€“10 minutes per module.

## Build
- Always invoke Maven in offline mode using the `-o` flag.
- To build the entire project without running tests:
  ```bash
  mvn -o verify -DskipTests
  ```
- To build the project and run all tests:
  ```bash
  mvn -o verify
  ```
  Running all modules sequentially will take a long time.
- Maven stores all build output in each module's `target/` directory. You can
  usually ignore these directories.

## Code Formatting
- This project has strict code formatting requirements. Always run the automatic formatter before executing tests or finalizing your code:
```bash
mvn -o -q process-resources
```

## Running Tests
- To test a specific module, use the `-pl` option. Example for running the SHACL tests:
  ```bash
  mvn -o -pl core/sail/shacl test
  ```
- Running from a module subdirectory is also possible; remember to include `-o`.

## Source File Headers
- All new source files must include the standard RDF4J copyright header.
- Use the template from `CONTRIBUTING.md` exactly as provided:
  ```

  ```
- Replace `${year}` with the current year for new files only.
- Do not modify or omit any other part of the header.
